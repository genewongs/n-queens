# n-queens

In this project, My pair programming partner and I worked through an intensive algorithm to implement a working application that tells a user how many queens is possible on each row in an N x N board. 

Some concepts that were deeply related in this project were recursion, decision trees, binary tree data structures, and navigating matrices. 


This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
